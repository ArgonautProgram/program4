Errors Documentation:

Circle.java:

Code calculating radius in Scale added factor instead of multiplying: Error was found by doubleRadiusTest()

radius = radius + factor; changed to radius = radius * factor;

Code calculating center.y added xOffset instead of yOffset: Error was found by simpleMoveNeg

center.y = center.y + xOffset; changed to center.y = center.y + yOffset;


Circle1.java:

If statement checking for intersection does not account for the calling circles radius
Error found was by intersectTest.

if (Math.abs(center.x - other.center.x) < radius &&
   Math.abs(center.y - other.center.y) < radius)

Changed to:

if (Math.abs(center.x - other.center.x) < radius &&
   Math.abs(center.y - other.center.y) < radius && radius <= other.radius)


Circle2.java:

Constructor does not use proper parameter placements, Error was found by simpleMove2 and simpleMoveNeg2.

Changed super(y,x,radius); to super(x,y,radius);
